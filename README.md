# Note Taker

## Description

- My motivation was a build an application that can help me make and keep track of notes
- I built this to help me take notes and delete notes dynamically
- The problem I solved is that I no longer have to keep track of papers or note pads that get messes or lost.

## Installation

- Once you have downloaded this repo, all you would have to do is to install the npm package by running this command in the terminal 'npm install'
- When you have completed the above step you would have to run this next command to start the server 'npm start'
- Once this is done open <http://localhost:3001> on your browser
